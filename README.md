Crystal Collector - The Game
1. This game starts off by giving the player a random number.
2. The user has to match the random number generated by selecting the crystals.
3. The crystals have a random number between 1-12 & they change after each game. The user doesn't see this random number and would have to match the total in order to win, otherwise the player loses.
